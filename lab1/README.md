**What is a User Story?** 

One of the most important aspects of moving to Agile is understanding ‚Äústories‚Äù. It takes practice to write good stories, and this exercise allows you this practice. As the Product Owner, you must deliver your customer‚Äôs or stakeholder‚Äôs perspective and share with the project team what is needed and why.

User Story is a tool in which requirements are captured in an easy to understand plain language, and is written from the perspective of an end user. 

A user story must provide value to some user. An Agile process is driven by the completion of stories, each of which provides tangible, demonstrable value to the user/customer/stakeholder. A sprint consists of a set of conscientiously prioritized stories. Experience will show that it‚Äôs best to use a format for each story that identifies who the user is, what they need, and for what purpose (the why). Such stories are written in this format:

```
‚ÄúAs a ____, I need a ____ in order to ____‚Äù.
```

or 

```
As a < user > 
I want to < perform an action > 
So that < I expect‚Ä¶. > 
```

* The **who / user** in a user story could be someone with a particular functional role, who holds a certain title in the application software, comes from the perspective of a persona, or embodies the needs and behaviors of a hypothetical user. ‚Äì ‚ÄúAs a net banking customer‚Äù;

* The **what / perform an action** in a user story details in specific terms the need, feature, or functionality desired by the who. This is what your project team will build into the product or service. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI want to add beneficiary in my account‚Äù;

* The **why / I expect** in a user story states the outcome and desired value. The user expects out of the action performed ‚Äì ‚Äúso that I can transfer money to the added beneficiary‚Äù.

Here‚Äôs an example of a user story that clearly defines the who, what, and why:
* *‚ÄúAs a jazz fan, I need a tuning knob in order to find a jazz station on the radio that I will enjoy listening to.‚Äù*.

User stories, based on the estimated size, are taken for implementation in an iteration. User stories should be granular enough that they can be completed within an iteration and cannot be continued in the following iteration. If a story cannot be completed within an iteration, the same should be split logically. User stories are prioritized by the product owner based on business priority and are available at the top of the product backlog. The dev team pulls the stories into an iteration backlog and implements them. The [Definition of Done(DOD)](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/done-understanding-definition-done?gclid=CjwKCAjwm8WZBhBUEiwA178UnFiFqICker4elVMX5oMU_LN-3V9opm5QzyoaX2zMIiFIRYlhl0MOwxoCZ5UQAvD_BwE) for user stories is decided by the team which includes acceptance criteria, and processes that need to be followed like unit testing, regression testing, code review, etc. The story is said to be ‚Äúdone‚Äù only when it meets the preset Definition of Done. 

**Keys to a Valuable User Story**
* Product Owners must have courage to ask for what they believe their users/customers/stakeholders really want.
* A story must have value to someone. It must make the product better in some way.
    * The story when complete will make a real-world task faster, better, easier to understand, have fewer steps, or collect better info;
    * The high priority stories affect the most users or procure the highest value dat;
    * Avoid exotic/one-off stories (i.e. edge cases).
* ‚ÄúClean up the bugs we introduced in the last sprint‚Äù is NOT a user story because it does not add anything to the product.
* Remember the INVEST model! Good user stories are:
    * **I**ndependent - User stories should be independent of other stories. There should be no overlap between them. They can however follow one after the other in a sequence, in a way that makes it easy to schedule and implement them;
    * **N**egotiable - The story should not be written in so much detail that it becomes a requirement document. If it is in too much detail, it does not give an opportunity for the dev team to have any conversation with the product owner or the business. The story should be written with just enough detail so that it paves the way to open discussions with the product owner or business, and helps to elicit details or come up with creative solutions. By negotiating on the story with the relevant stakeholders, teams can come to a common understanding;
    * **V**aluable - The story should be valuable to the customer. It should clearly state why we are doing this? How is it going to produce value to the customer? What value will the customer realize by implementing this story?
    * **E**stimable - The user stories should have sufficient detail for the dev team to understand and estimate them. The conversation in 3 C‚Äôs helps the team to uncover the details with the product owner and stakeholders, so that they can size the story. If the story is too big and not sizeable, then the story should be refined or decomposed further. Whatever information the team may require should be available in the story for them to estimate it. In case there is a part of the story where the team has to do research, then a ‚Äúspike‚Äù story may be created while the rest of the story can be estimated and taken for implementation;
    * **S**mall and - Good user stories should be small. This does not refer to the size or number of words written in a story. A small story is of the right length so that the implementation team can complete the story within an iteration. It should be small enough that the story is ‚Äúfully delivered‚Äù during an iteration;
    * **T**estable - Testable ‚Äì A good user story should be testable in order to be ‚ÄúDone‚Äù. This is supported by the ‚ÄúConfirmation‚Äù in 3 C‚Äôs where the team comes up with acceptance criteria for every story after the detailed conversation with the stakeholders. 
        * The customer should be clear about what he should test during the review. If he is not clear, then the story is not good enough to be implemented.
        * The team works together in a collaborative way to INVEST in good stories. The team learns to write good user stories as they work together and also proactively think about the values and criteria that are laid out in INVEST. 

**Types of User Stories**

We can classify user stories into functional and technical types: 

* **Functional** ‚Äì Normally, a user story is written based on the functional aspects of the application software, while focusing on the user and the value of the functionality provided to the user. Functional stories concentrate on the product features which the customer will be testing at the end of an iteration based on the acceptance criteria defined for the story. 

* **Technical** ‚Äì Technical stories are written to be able to support the functional stories. Technical stories can be classified as:
    * **Infrastructure stories** ‚Äì any infrastructure addition/modification that may be required to support the functional story;
    * **Refactoring** ‚Äì this type of story is written to maintain the code and address technical debts. This can be used for designing and automation needs as wel;
    * **Spikes** ‚Äì stories that require research on architecture and design which may in turn help achieve the functional need of the custome.
